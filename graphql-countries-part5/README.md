# GraphQL Countries Part 5

This part is a continuation of [graphql-countries-part2](https://github.com/luisw19/graphql-samples/tree/master/graphql-countries-part2).

In this part we'll include an Oracle JET UI to compare REST and GraphQL calls, both using the [REST Countries API](https://github.com/apilayer/restcountries)
as a data source.

Step-by-Step instructions are found in the Service and UI folders.
